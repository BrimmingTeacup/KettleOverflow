## Planning Stage

- We planned out our [database](https://github.com/boothjacobs/KettleOverflow/wiki/Database-Schema)  making sure that we made deliberate choices on which models were connected.
- We wrote the [API routes](https://github.com/boothjacobs/KettleOverflow/wiki/API-Documentation) using RESTful naming conventions.
- We talked through what we wanted the user experience to be. 
	- We made a deliberate choice to not let users delete questions.
	- We created a [feature list](https://github.com/boothjacobs/KettleOverflow/wiki/Feature-List) that walks through how the user interacts with the features we planned to create.
	- We wrote the [frontend routes](https://github.com/boothjacobs/KettleOverflow/wiki/Frontend-Routes)with the user experience in mind.

## Future Features

-	Customizable profile for each account including profile photos
-	Organizing questions into categories
	-	Tags attached to each question
